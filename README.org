* Emacs multi eshell buffer managing tool
  GNU Emacs extension for managing multiple eshell buffers and windows.
  Basically this is a [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/multi-eshell][multi-eshell]] (which has a bit misleading name and stands for Multi Emacs Shell,
  and in fact does not do well with real *eshell*) rewrite specifically to support Emacs's *eshell*.

** Installation
*** With Straight package manager
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package
 '(el-patch :host github :repo "slamko/emacs-multi-eshell"
            :branch "master"))
#+end_src
*** Or cloning the repo and loading the path
#+begin_src sh
git clone git@github.com:slamko/emacs-multi-eshell.git
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/path-to-repo")
(require 'emacs-multi-eshell)
#+end_src

** Features
   The package provides two functions for creating and switching between *eshell* buffers:
   
   1. *ees/eshell-new*  - create new eshell buffer and switches to it.
   2. *ees/eshell-last* - switch to last created buffer, if no was found - create one.
